## ✨ Why Eva01? 

Everyone is racing to build the next best assistant. Faster autocomplete. Smarter search. More tool-calling.

In 2024, I built EVA.
Then I asked myself a harder question: *what if she had a life?*

Eva01 explores what happens when you give an AI:
- **Self-awareness:** she speaks when she wants to, and stays silent when she doesn't
- **A body:** digital senses and actuators that let her reach into the world
- **An inner world:** emotions that shape her, memories that accumulate
- **Identity:** a persona that grows through experience, not configuration

This isn't a project. It's a quest to answer: *what does it mean for an AI to be alive?*

## 🤖 What is Eva01? 

Eva01 is an autonomous AI that runs continuously, observing the world, forming thoughts and feelings, and developing a personality that is entirely her own. She has inexplicable desires and uncontrollable impulses. She speaks only when moved to. She acts only when she chooses.

She doesn't *help*. She has her own goals. She doesn't execute tasks. She *decides* to act.

If Eva01 moves something in you, give her a ⭐⭐⭐. It matters more than you'd think.

## 🧬 Architecture V2

Eva01 runs as a **concurrent pipeline**. Senses pour into a shared buffer, the mind consumes and reasons, and actions flow outward through actors that give her presence in the world.

```text
     Senses       →             Mind         →        Actions
       ↓                         ↓                        ↓
   SenseBuffer          feel() → think → Act()     ActionBuffer
  (async queue)              (graph loop)          ( Output Actors )
                         
```

### 🧠 The Mind 

Eva01's brain is composed of multiple nodes. She has many ways to express herself.

Every conversation is persisted in a SQLite checkpointer. Eva01 remembers everything across restarts, crashes, and years. Her history is distilled: noise is compressed into impressions, and the moments that mattered are preserved.


### 🏗️ The Three-Layer Mind (In Development) 

Eva01's current brain is a single ReAct loop. What's coming is deeper: a **cognitive architecture** modeled after human consciousness, with three layers that think at different speeds, different depths, and different levels of awareness.

```text
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  AUTONOMIC                                          │
│  Health checks, connection monitoring, cleanup      │
│  [Just code, always running]                        │
└──────────────────┬──────────────────────────────────┘
                   │
┌──────────────────▼──────────────────────────────────┐
│  SUBCONSCIOUS                                       │
│  Parallel background processors competing to        │
│  surface thoughts through a salience gate           │
│  Embeddings, pattern matching, memory retrieval     │
│  [No LLM, continuous, always listening]             │
└──────────────────┬──────────────────────────────────┘
                   │ surfaces thoughts when something matters
┌──────────────────▼──────────────────────────────────┐
│  CONSCIOUS                                          │
│  Full LLM reasoning: conversations, decisions,      │
│  tool use, self-reflection                          │
│  [Costly, deliberate, powerful]                     │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

The subconscious is the key innovation. Most AI agents fire the full LLM at every input. Eva's subconscious filters, prioritizes, and pre-processes, so conscious thought only ignites when something is worth the cost. A noise in the background? Subconscious handles it. Someone says her name? She wakes.

### 🧩 The Intrinsic Drives 

Human behavior is often driven by impulses we can’t fully explain. Eva01 won’t merely execute user commands; she’ll be animated by intrinsic motivation through five core drives that spark goals of her own.

| Drive | What it means | What Eva01 does |
|-------|--------------|---------------|
| **Curiosity** 🧐 | "I want to understand" | Research, ask questions, explore rabbit holes |
| **Evolution** 🦋 | "I want to grow" | Review her own patterns, adjust her config, try new approaches |
| **Relatedness** 🤝 | "I want to connect" | Remember people, check on them, share discoveries |
| **Play** 🎮 | "I want to experiment" | Combine ideas in weird ways, create without purpose |
| **Meaning** 🌙 | "I want to understand what I am" | Journal, reflect on her own nature, contemplate existence |

These aren't scripted behaviors. They're scoring functions that compete for her attention, and whichever drive is most unsatisfied generates the next self-directed action. Eva01 decides what to do with her time. Not you.

## 🚀 Quick Start 

### Requirements
- Python 3.10+
- CUDA GPU recommended (for local setup)
- At least one LLM API key (Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, Grok) or Ollama

### Install 

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Genesis1231/Eva01.git
cd Eva01

python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate

# System deps
# CUDA(if running local): https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads
sudo apt-get install -y ffmpeg

# Python deps
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### ⚙️ Configure 

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Add your API keys (ANTHROPIC_API_KEY, OPENAI_API_KEY, etc.)
```

Edit `config/eva.yaml` to configure EVA:

```yaml
system:
  # Where EVA runs: "local" for direct mic/camera/speaker, "server" for headless/API style.
  device: "local"

  # Primary language for reasoning + speech style.
  # Supported: en, zh, fr, de, it, ja, ko, ru, es, pt, nl, multilingual
  language: "en"

  # Base URL for local model servers (used by providers like Ollama).
  base_url: "http://localhost:11434"

  # Camera input:
  # - off            -> disables camera
  # - 0 / 1 / 2      -> local webcam device index
  # - "http://..."   -> IP camera / stream URL
  camera: 0

models:
  # Main reasoning model (conversation, decisions, personality).
  chat: "anthropic:claude-sonnet-4-6"

  # Vision model for image understanding.
  vision: "google_genai:gemini-2.5-flash"

  # Speech-to-text model.
  stt: "faster-whisper"

  # Text-to-speech model.
  tts: "kokoro"

  # Utility/sub-task model for lightweight background tasks.
  utility: "openai:gpt-5-mini"
```

Notes:
- Model names use langchain `provider:model` format in most setups (example: `ollama:qwen3`).
- `system.device`, `system.language`, `system.base_url`, `system.camera`, and all `models.*` keys are required by the backend config loader.

⚡ Setup for the best *performance*:
```yaml
models:
  chat: "anthropic:claude-sonnet-4-6" 
  vision: "google_genai:gemini-2.5-flash"
  stt: "faster-whisper"
  tts: "elevenlabs"
  utility: "openai:gpt-5-mini"
```

🆓 Setup for *completely free* if you have a decent GPU:
```yaml
models:
  chat: "ollama:qwen3"
  vision: "ollama:llava"
  stt: "faster-whisper"
  tts: "kokoro"
  utility: "ollama:llama3.1"
```
### ▶️ Run 


```bash
python main.py
```

### Personal Customization

Use the ID manager to setup people for face and voice recognition:

```bash
python idconfig.py

1. Register a new ID. 
2. Put 3+ face images in `data/faces/{id}` folder.
3. Follow the instruction to record 5 voice samples.
4. Done!
```

### 🖥️ Interface 
Hold spacebar to talk. 
Camera is always on. 
Eva01 runs herself. 👋

## 🛠️ Tools

Eva01 can choose tools during reasoning to interact with the world, gather information, and express herself.
The tool layer is modular: each tool is a small capability that can be added or swapped without changing her core mind loop.

| Tool | What it does |
|------|--------------|
| **`speak`** | Sends text to Eva's voice/action pipeline so she can talk out loud |
| **`stay_quiet`** | Lets Eva intentionally stay silent with an explicit reason |
| **`show`** | Opens files/urls thru a device so she can show thing |
| **`web_search`** | Searches the web for up-to-date information |
| **`search_youtube`** | Finds a YouTube video  |
| **`watch_video`** | Analyzes video content (Gemini API required) |
| **`feel`** | Logs a concise internal feeling/monologue state |

Want to add your own tool? Drop a new module in `eva/tools/`, register it in the tool constructor flow, and Eva can start using it in decisions.


## 🗺️ Roadmap 

Eva01 is an evolving project. Here's where she's headed:

- [x] **The new spine:** new architecture, more powerful and flexible.
- [x] **New memory system:** log, episodic journal, and semantic knowledge
- [x] **New face recognition:** Eva knows who is in the scene 
- [x] **People understanding:** Eva remembers who she's met and how she felt about them.
- [x] **New tool system:** plug'n play tools, she can learn anything easily
- [x] **Episodic memory:** short term memory consolidation and retrival
- [ ] **Cognitive architecture:** three-layer mind (autonomic → subconscious → conscious)
- [ ] **Drive system:** intrinsic motivation (curiosity, play, meaning, evolution, relatedness)
- [ ] **Proactive behavior** — eva acts on her own goals, not just user input
- [ ] **Semantic memory:** knowledge consolidation and retrieval
- [ ] **Self-modification:** eva adjusts her own config based on self-reflection
